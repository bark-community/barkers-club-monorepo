# Barker´s Hub Monorepo
Proof of Concept

Welcome to the Barker’s Hub Monorepo, the central hub for all development related to our vibrant community of BARK token holders. This monorepo houses the codebase for both the Barker´s Hub application and the Barker's Club website, providing a unified development environment for building and maintaining our digital platforms.

## Overview

The Barker’s Hub Monorepo is organized into two main projects:

1. **Barker´s Hub Application**: This project contains the codebase for the Barker´s Hub application, a dynamic platform that facilitates community engagement, governance, and interactions among BARKER, BARK and Club tokens holders. The application is built using Angular and leverages Solana blockchain technology to provide transparent and efficient, social and financial solutions.

2. **Barker's Club Website**: This project contains the codebase for the Barker's Club website, the official online presence of our community. The website serves as a gateway for newcomers to learn about the Barker's Club, explore membership benefits, and stay updated on the latest news and events. It is built using Next.js and TypeScript for a modern and responsive user experience.
